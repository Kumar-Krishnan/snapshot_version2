## Project Goal and Description:
The project goal was to build an that allowed users to take multiple psychological self-assesments for measure such as depression, impulsivity, and anxiety and then allow users to track their scores and changes in their scores across time.

The app allows users to take full tests, have the scores recorded, and then view the scores they received over time ranges in graphical form.

The main technologies I was focused on familiarizing myself with were SQL, being able to visualize and think in SQL vs a document model, then secondly exploring graphing libraries for react. 

Moving from NoSQL to SQL, I was able to use references to accomplish complex functionality without duplicating data as frequently, and more importantly it made it much easier to analyse the relationship between tables and break down data in a quantitative and analytical way for front-end users.

                    
## Future Directions, things not got to:
* In the future, I would like to explore the user of timeseries libraries for exploring graphing on react.

* Utilize more numericality validations. 

* Integrate an authentication method to utilize passwords.

* Utilize redux to manage state

* Allow users to track the
