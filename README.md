## Project Goal and Description:
The project goal was to build an that allowed users to take multiple psychological self-assesments for measure such as depression, impulsivity, and anxiety and then allow users to track their scores and changes in their scores across time.

The main technologies I was focused on familiarizing myself with were SQL, being able to visualize and think in SQL vs a document model. Then secondly exploring graphing libraries for react. 

                    
## Future Directions, things not got to:
* In the future, I would like to explore the user of timeseries libraries for exploring graphing on react.

* Finish questions and answers model and have a richer data model and experience.

* Utilize more numericality validations. 

* Integrate an authentication method to utilize passwords.

* Utilize redux to manage state
